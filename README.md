# VORON Legacy Mods

The [VORON Legacy](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Legacy) is canonically a 230x230x230mm<sup>3</sup> 3D printer.

Ever wanted to make one that's 430x430x430mm<sup>3</sup> instead?

It does actually print well! I have not run into any issues with it.

Here's all the modified STLs I used to make it work.

_everything else should be pulled straight from the VORON Legacy stock design_
